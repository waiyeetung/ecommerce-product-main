### Useful resources

- [Lightbox Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_lightbox.asp) - This has been a great guide to create a light box using concepts from modals and slideshows. 

- [Sidebar](https://bootstrapious.com/p/bootstrap-sidebar) - This article helped me understand the different ways to create a sidebar. Prior to this, I've only created navbar that collapsed into a hambuger menu and drops down from the top, this was a new experience for me.
